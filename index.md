# About Me

<img src=".\images\ziteng1.JPG" class="floatpic">


Here is **Ziteng Gao** [(Michael, 高紫腾)](https://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/profiles/hc663).<br>

I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student at Harbin Institute of Technology Shenzhen(HITSZ), majored in computer science, where I am fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Shuo Yang](https://shuoyang-1998.github.io/).

Before joining HITSZ, I was a MLE at XPENG Motors, focused on autonomous driving, including End-to-End, imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and supervied fine-tune(SFT).

More prior, I got my MSc degree in Mechanical Engineering from National University of Singapore(NUS), and received my B.Eng. degree in Mechatronics from Harbin Institute of Technology(HIT).


I am always open to academic discussions and potential collaborations. Please feel free to reach out to me at **e1010863 [at] u.nus.edu**
